## neovim

- a minimal(ish) config written entirely in lua, taking advantage of the built-in lsp support.

  - was unhappy with [coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) -- too opinionated, not enough plugins (i.e. tailwindcss), and docs geared towards vimscript.
  - eventually needed to set up lsp for proper [t/jsx commenting](https://github.com/JoosepAlviste/nvim-ts-context-commentstring) and [t/jsx pair renaming](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-ts-autotag)

- heavily inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch)
